Undergraduate Researcher, Social Computing Laboratory | Aug 2023 - Present<br>
Mentor: Dr. Eshwar Chandrasekharan <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Measure the efficacy of positive reinforcement moderation on subreddits.
    </li>
                
    <li>
      Identify examples of positive reinforcement in historical data spanning over 2000 posts and comments using Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) and Pandas in Python.
    </li>
    <li>
      Analyze data from before and after the positive reinforcement moderation to understand the impact on user behaviour.
    </li>

  Independent Study (CS 397) | Aug 2023 - Present<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Koustuv Saha <br>
  <ul>            
    <li> 
      Understand the disparities between human comments and the outputs generated by LLMs for the same queries about Alzheimers.            
    </li>
                
    <li>  
      Collected the 50 top questions from the r/Alzheimers subreddit using Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW). Compared the results generated by large language models like ChatGPT using the OpenAI API to the responses in the subreddit.          
    </li>
                
    <li>
      Perform qualitative analysis on Reddit generated and LLM generated results for the the top 30 posts using inductive coding to gain insights into this data.            
    </li>

  CS Student Ambassador/Research Scholar | Jan 2023 - Present<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>            
  <ul>            
    <li>            
      Pursue research focused on discovering methods that can efficiently identify code patterns in domains that interest non-majors.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Searched the literature to identify applicable techniques. Assess the capabilities of code similarity algorithms, edit distances, and other systems for code idiom mining to support pattern identification.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Created a dataset by collecting over 20,000 code pieces from Stack Overflow across different Python topics including Pandas, TensorFlow, and MatPlotLib via web-scraping using Beautiful Soup in Python.
    </li>

  Undergraduate Summer Research Intern | May 2023 - Jul 2023<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>     
  <ul>            
    <li>            
      Interviewed 10 educators who identified novel programming patterns to investigate the state of art of pattern identification for instructional purposes, its challenges, and how technology can help make this process more efficient.
    </li>                            
    <li>            
      Performed qualitative coding on the interview transcripts to thematically analyze the methodology and draw conclusions about how educators find and create programming patterns. Discussed the design of a socio-technical system that can automate this process.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Submitted the findings as a research paper to the ACM CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
    </li>
