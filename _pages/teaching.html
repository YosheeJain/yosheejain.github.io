<p><strong>Siebel School of Computing and Data Science. University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</strong><br> 
Undergraduate Research Scholar, TRAILS Lab | Jan 2023 - Present<br>
Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pursuing research to design a socio-technical system to assist instructors in efficiently identifying common code patterns in application-focused domains like web development with Django, that interest non-computer science majors.
    </li>
                
    <li>
      Implementing a web interface to formulate a question generator that creates various types of questions, including multiple-choice, reordering, and fill-in-the-blank tasks using programming patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designed an LLM-powered pipeline that can suggest candidate programming patterns using chain-of-thought prompting to identify code examples and clustering similar code snippets into patterns. 
    </li>  
    <li>
      Co-administered a design workshop with this design artifact with 7 experts from 3 domains to understand what interactions best assist instructors in navigating these candidate patterns efficiently and effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed a web application framework using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Flask to create PLAID, an interface that assists instructors in designing programming patterns in any application-focused domain as part of the Illinois CS Summer Research Program.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conducted an evaluation study with 12 instructors from 3 domains using validated survey instruments, including the NASA TLX cognitive load survey and PSSUQ usability survey in a think aloud setting. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Grounded the design of the LLM-powered pipeline using results from a formative study with 10 instructors. Performed qualitative coding on the interview transcripts to thematically analyze how educators find and create programming patterns and its key challenges.
    </li>
    <li>
      Presented preliminary ideas to identify programming patterns and evaluate their quality as a poster at ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research in Jul. 2023.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Independent Study (CS 397) | Aug 2023 - Present<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Koustuv Saha <br>
  <ul>            
    <li> 
      Understand the disparities between human comments and the outputs generated by LLMs for the same queries about Alzheimers.            
    </li>
                
    <li>  
      Collected the 50 top questions from the r/Alzheimers subreddit using Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW). Compared the results generated by large language models like ChatGPT using the OpenAI API to the responses in the subreddit.          
    </li>
                
    <li>
      Perform qualitative analysis on Reddit generated and LLM generated results for the the top 30 posts using inductive coding to gain insights into this data.            
    </li>            
  </ul>

  CS Student Ambassador/Research Scholar | Jan 2023 - Present<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>            
  <ul>            
    <li>            
      Pursue research focused on discovering methods that can efficiently identify code patterns in domains that interest non-majors.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Searched the literature to identify applicable techniques. Assess the capabilities of code similarity algorithms, edit distances, and other systems for code idiom mining to support pattern identification.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Created a dataset by collecting over 20,000 code pieces from Stack Overflow across different Python topics including Pandas, TensorFlow, and MatPlotLib via web-scraping using Beautiful Soup in Python.
    </li>

  Undergraduate Summer Research Intern | May 2023 - Jul 2023<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>     
  <ul>            
    <li>            
      Interviewed 10 educators who identified novel programming patterns to investigate the state of art of pattern identification for instructional purposes, its challenges, and how technology can help make this process more efficient.
    </li>                            
    <li>            
      Performed qualitative coding on the interview transcripts to thematically analyze the methodology and draw conclusions about how educators find and create programming patterns. Discussed the design of a socio-technical system that can automate this process.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Submitted the findings as a research paper to the ACM CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
