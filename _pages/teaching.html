Undergraduate Research Scholar, TRAILS Lab | Jan 2023 - Present<br>
Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pursuing research to design a socio-technical system to assist instructors in efficiently identifying common code patterns in application-focused domains like web development with Django, that interest non-computer science majors.
    </li>
                
    <li>
      Implementing a web interface to formulate a question generator that creates various types of questions, including multiple-choice, reordering, and fill-in-the-blank tasks using programming patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designed an LLM-powered pipeline that can suggest candidate programming patterns using chain-of-thought prompting to identify code examples and clustering similar code snippets into patterns. 
    </li>  
    <li>
      Co-administered a design workshop with this design artifact with 7 experts from 3 domains to understand what interactions best assist instructors in navigating these candidate patterns efficiently and effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed a web application framework using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Flask to create PLAID, an interface that assists instructors in designing programming patterns in any application-focused domain as part of the Illinois CS Summer Research Program.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conducted an evaluation study with 12 instructors from 3 domains using validated survey instruments, including the NASA TLX cognitive load survey and PSSUQ usability survey in a think aloud setting. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Grounded the design of the LLM-powered pipeline using results from a formative study with 10 instructors. Performed qualitative coding on the interview transcripts to thematically analyze how educators find and create programming patterns and its key challenges.
    </li>
    <li>
      Presented preliminary ideas to identify programming patterns and evaluate their quality as a poster at ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research in Jul. 2023.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Undergraduate Research Intern | May 2024 - Present<br>            
  Mentors: Dr. Jionghao Lin, Dr. John Hollander, Liang Zhang, Dr. John Sabatini <br>
  <ul>            
    <li> 
      Examining the inconsistencies and weaknesses in the properties of large language models in performing reading comprehension tasks. Submitting the findings as a proposal to HCI International 2025 Conference.
    </li>
                
    <li>  
      Inspecting the quality of these multiple choice questions using linguistic characteristic comparisons with human-generated questions.
    </li>
                
    <li>
      Coded a RAG-based pipeline for question generation using a few-shot prompting approach to the OpenAI API with readings given to students as context.
    </li>          
    <li>
      Assessed the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering human-generated questions and evaluated its question-generation capabilities in reading comprehension.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed a tutor-learner simulation with Autogen,  enabling a multi-agent interaction-based environment where the learner agent answered questions generated by the tutor agent, and the tutor adapted the difficulty of the questions depending on the learners' responses. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  CS Student Ambassador/Research Scholar | Jan 2023 - Present<br>            
  Mentor: Dr. Kathryn Cunningham <br>            
  <ul>            
    <li>            
      Pursue research focused on discovering methods that can efficiently identify code patterns in domains that interest non-majors.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Searched the literature to identify applicable techniques. Assess the capabilities of code similarity algorithms, edit distances, and other systems for code idiom mining to support pattern identification.
    </li>            
    <li>            
      Created a dataset by collecting over 20,000 code pieces from Stack Overflow across different Python topics including Pandas, TensorFlow, and MatPlotLib via web-scraping using Beautiful Soup in Python.
    </li>
