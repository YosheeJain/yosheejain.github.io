I am a sophomore pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a passion for software development and programming. My research interests include Algorithms, AI and ML, Interactive Computing, and Computers and Education. I believe that technology can be a force for bringing about significant change in the world and making it a better place. From innovating to teaching and many activities in between, I've dipped my toes in all of them. I've thrived leading my teams and testing my creativity. I intend to use computing's power to foster innovation, turn our enthusiasm and ideas into solutions, build and strengthen teams, and work collaboratively. With the unique opportunities, I am able to make use of cutting-edge technology to develop my entrepreneurial mindset by connecting with faculty, alums, and external partners to innovate in diverse areas.

side from academics, I love to dance, travel, and eat ice-creams!
